Last week:
G1. Federal receipts (and spending) are 3% higher is positive news.
G2. The Fed may be walking back the tough talk from last month is another positive news
G3. As per ADP report, private payrolls grew by 205K is third poitive news in market

B1:Earnings reports so far have disappointed.
B2: ISM manufacturing and services are below expected number.
B3: Initial jobless claims edged higher.
B4: overall non-farm payroll gain disappointed.
B5:total margin debt hit its peak last April, and is now nearly 10% lower (total amount investors borrow to purchase stocks rises during bull markets and falls during bear market). Although 6 out of 10 cases this is really meaningless.
